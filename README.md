# Scientific Calculator 

This is a simple **Scientific Calculator** project implemented in **Java**, showcasing the concept of **method overriding** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## ‚ú® Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Scientific operations: Power, Square Root, Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), Logarithmic functions
- Demonstrates OOP concepts, especially **inheritance** and **method overriding**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or later)
- IDE: Any Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans)

## üìö OOP Concept: Method Overriding

Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. In this project:

- A `Calculator` superclass contains basic operations.
- A `ScientificCalculator` subclass overrides some methods to extend or modify behavior.
